# Events-Manager
Events Manager is a web app that helps you manage an event-center.
Given you manage an events center, this app will help you accept applications to use your center / facilities, and will either decline events when the proposed day is already taken, or suggest an available day.

## Getting Started
A live version of the UI templates can be accessed [here](https://efosaok.github.io/Events-Manager/)
